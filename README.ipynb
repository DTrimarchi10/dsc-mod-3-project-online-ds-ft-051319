    "This notebook contains an analysis of data pertaining to a ficticious company named Northwind. All of the data used in this project comes from the Northwind Database. The data is accessed using SQL queries in python and all other data manipulation and analysis is completed in python jupyter notebooks. Northwind is a company that manages the global sales of various food products between suppliers and customers. A majority of the data is focused on specific orders and the associated order details.\n",

    "The questions I posed are written below for convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?\n",
    "2. Does discount have a statistically significant effect on average order revenue? i.e. Are we lowering average order revenue when we provide a discount?\n",
    "3. Does sales representative have a statistically significant effect on order revenue? i.e. Are certain sales reps getting higher average order prices?\n",
    "4. Does unit price impact how much a customer spends? How about quantity that a customer orders?\n",
    "5. Do Meat/Poultry products have a statistically significant effect on total order price?\n",
    "\n",
    "For all tests described in this report, a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 was used.\n",

    "Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?\n",
    "What discount level matters the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "* **Ho:** There is no difference in the mean product quantity ordered between customers who received a discount and those who did not receive a discount.\n",
    "* **Ha:** The mean product quantity ordered for those who received a discount will be greater than the mean product quantity ordered by customers who did not receive a discount. i.e. mean quantity for discounted > 21.72\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Query Used\n",
    "The following query was used to obtain the base set of data. It is a simple full-table query as all of the relevant data is available in the OrderDetail table.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Tukey Test\n",
    "The Tukey test shows where there are statistically significant differences in quantity for each discount level. Group1 in the table represents full price (0.00 discount) and Group2 represents each of the other discount levels. The **Null Hypothesis is rejected in all discount levels with the exception of 0.10.**\n",

    "### Conclusions / Recommendations\n",
    "Discount levels of 0.05, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 have a statistically significant correlation with quantity ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ranked discount levels by effect size are: 15%, 25%, 5%, 20%. However, in all cases the effect is small to medium (between 0.2 and 0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "For discount levels of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 6%, there was not enough data. For discount level of 10%, there was not a statistically significant correlation to quantity ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results I would recommend that the company avoid giving 10% discounts as they do not impact order quantity and therefore represent a loss of 10% revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also would also ask the company to consider that 15% discounts have a greater effect on quantity ordered than 20%, and 25% discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on inventory, product expiration, etc, there are instances where increasing quantity of product per order is beneficial. In these instances, 15% and 25% discount levels would have the greatest effect. \n",

    "* **Ho:** There is no difference in the mean total revenue per order between customers who received a discount and those who did not receive a discount.\n",
    "* **Ha:** The mean total revenue per order for those who received a discount will be significantly different than the mean total revenue per order by customers who did not receive a discount. i.e. mean revenue per order for discounted != 570.01. - Two tailed\n",

    "### Database Querys Used\n",
    "The following query was used to obtain the base set of data. The price per order (TotalPrice) is feature engineered through the SQL Query. I did not group the individual line items within an order because for some orders, individual line items are discounted while others are not. This means that for this test, individual product line items within an order are being evaluated as an \"order\".\n",

    "#### Tukey Test\n",
    "The Tukey test below shows which discount levels have a statistically significant impact on order revenue.

    "### Conclusions / Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Discount has a statistically significant correlation with order revenue for the 5% discount level. For all other discount levels, the Null Hypothesis failed to be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results I would recommend that the company consider that a 5% discount results in greater revenue per order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be due to a combination of the customer ordering more product because of the presence of the discount, and the discount being small enough to limit negative impact to revenue. Further investigation and experimentation would be interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this test shows that applying a discount does not negatively correlate with average order revenue.\n",

    "\n",
    "This may provide insight into which sales reps are pushing for higher dollar orders/products vs. quantity of orders. The results may provide valueable information to management about rewards systems - quanity/quality of a sale. Also to help figure out who may be undervalued in the organization.\n",

    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "* **Ho:** There is no difference in the mean order revenue for different sales representatives.\n",

    "\n",
    "Even though some of the employees have a higher number of orders and higher Total Revenue, their order prices remain similar. No one employee stands out here. The difference in total sales per employee is being driven by number of orders instead of average order revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can indicate many things. There may be a general lack of relationship between sales representatives and customers which would remove any impact individuals might have on the sales process. It could indicate that standardization among the sales process overrides any independent action of the salesperson. It could be that order price is determined by market factors. It could also be coincidental.\n",
